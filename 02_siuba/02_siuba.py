# LEARNING PANDAS ----
# - Siuba is great for when you are coming from R to Python (like me)
# - Teams use Pandas: 99% of data wranlging code is written with Pandas
# - Better Learn Pandas if you want to be part of the Team

# I TEACH PANDAS (FROM AN R-USERS PERSPECTIVE)!
# Python for Data Science Automation Course (Contains 5 hours of Pandas)
